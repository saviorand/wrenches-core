# Collect important problems

**Discover problems to tackle from open idea banks \(yes, it's a thing\)**



**Learn about existing problems from your past releases \(From "Shape Up" by Basecamp\)**

* Shipping can actually generate new work, because feature releases tend to generate feature requests.
* It’s important to stay cool and avoid knee-jerk reactions. Give it a few days to settle down and then re-evaluate the situation.
* It can be tempting to commit to making changes/fixes based on the initial reaction you get from customers, but then you will no longer have a clean slate for the next cycle
* Saying “yes” to these right away takes away your freedom, whereas a gentle “not right now” leaves the door open to addressing the concern in the future
* We have come full circle…these customer demands are raw ideas and will need to be evaluated, shaped, and scoped before they can hope to make it into a future cycle
