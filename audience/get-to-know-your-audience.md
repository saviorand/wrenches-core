# Get to know your audience



* **Choose 1 to 5 communities that the audience defined previously enjoys and refers to for advice and/or inspiration**.

You can also look for podcasts, newsletters, blogs or forums. It can basically be every place where people engage in social exchange.

* **Listen carefully and learn.**

Contribute by answering questions and help people out with advice. Do not spam and be respective to others.

* **Pay close attention to these people's feelings and needs.**

Talk less about yourself and more about them.

* **Repeat this on a regular basis to become a known member of the community.**

It will come naturally that other community members will start recognizing you and pay close attention to your ideas and thoughts.
